  # Debug cleanup_logs access issue

  1. Problem Analysis
    - Records exist in cleanup_logs table but not visible to admin users
    - Likely RLS policy issue with auth.uid() vs custom user system
    - Need to fix policies for custom authentication system

  2. Solution
    - Remove existing policies that rely on auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that work with custom user authentication
    - Allow admin users to access cleanup_logs based on is_admin flag

  3. Security
    - Maintain security by checking is_admin flag
    - Allow system operations for edge functions
